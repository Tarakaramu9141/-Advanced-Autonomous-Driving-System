# 🚗 Advanced Autonomous Driving System

![Demo GIF](demo.gif) *(Keep this under 5MB)*

A real-time computer vision system for autonomous vehicle perception, featuring lane detection, object recognition, and control logic. Perfect for showcasing to autonomous vehicle companies like Tesla and BYD.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Multi-class Object Detection** (80+ classes including vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, trees, and buildings)
- **Adaptive Night Vision** with CLAHE enhancement
- **Lane Detection & Counting** with Hough Transform
- **Control System** with speed/steering logic
- **Real-time Processing** (15-30 FPS on RTX 3050)
- **Streamlit Web UI** for easy demonstration

## 🛠️ Customization

# In object_detection.py
self.categories = {
    'vehicles': [2,3,5,7],    # Cars, trucks, buses
    'traffic': [9,11,13],     # Lights and signs
    'pedestrians': [0],       # People
    'environment': [56,59]    # Trees, plants
}


##  🚀 Installation 

1. **Clone Repository** (2 Minutes)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autonomous-driving.git
   cd autonomous-driving

2. Install Dependencies (~5 minutes)
